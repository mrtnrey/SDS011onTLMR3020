# Fine dust sensor SDS011 on a flashed router
Reading a SDS011 sensor on a flashed TP-Link TL-MR3020 running LEDE and send values to madavi.de

## CAUTION
Although the software is tested & running on my own device, you should be aware of flashing a router is not without risk.
At least some basic knowledge of linux is required.
If you flash your router,
- warranty is lost
- firmware of manufacturer is lost
- bricking your router is not completely excluded.

Concerning latter point: the TL-MR3020 router can be unbricked quite easily (own experience...).

## How to install
For installing the software, you have two possibilities
- flash your TL-MR3020 with a LEDE image containing everything you need
- build it yourself with the instructions and sources prodived

### Method 1: flash with LEDE images
### Method 2: build it yourself
